# GPSKit
A collection of useful things we have learned about working with GPS hardware and data

## Resources
http://freenmea.net

## Tools

`test.nmea` is just a random sample generated by the freenmea.net emitter: http://freenmea.net/emitter
`nmea2geojson.py` Converts a file of NMEA strings to a GeoJSON multipoint

## Feather GPSKit

This kit is based on the Adafruit Feather system using the Adalogger and the Ultimate GPS Feather wing. Other kits may follow at some point

The full set of materials is in this wishlist: https://www.adafruit.com/wishlists/446492. Note that the antenna and adapter are optional.

You will also need to select a 3.7v LiPoly battery: https://www.adafruit.com/category/44_138


### Assembly

 - solder short female stacking headers onto your Adalogger
 - solder standard male headers onto your GPS wing
 - stack them together

### Code

TBD

[KnightLab_GPS](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/KnightLab_GPS) has GPS reading code

[SensorGrid](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/SensorGrid) has SD card [logging code](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/SensorGrid/blob/master/io.cpp#L139)

## Data Wrangling and hosting

TBD. Will probably do a reference example using S3 to host the data. Perhaps GitHub static files also

## Mapping

TBD
