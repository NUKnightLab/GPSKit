# GPSKit
A collection of useful things we have learned about working with GPS hardware and data

## Resources

## Tools

`test.nmea` is just a random sample generated by the freenmea.net emitter: http://freenmea.net/emitter
`nmea2geojson.py` Converts a file of NMEA strings to a GeoJSON multipoint

## Feather GPSKit

This kit is based on the Adafruit Feather system using the Adalogger and the Ultimate GPS Feather wing.

The full set of materials is in this wishlist: https://www.adafruit.com/wishlists/446492. Note that the antenna and adapter are optional.

You will also need to select a 3.7v LiPoly battery: https://www.adafruit.com/category/44_138

Other kits may follow at some point

### Assembly

 - solder short female stacking headers onto your Adalogger
 - solder standard male headers onto your GPS wing
